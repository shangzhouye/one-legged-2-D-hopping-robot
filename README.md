# Overview

This is the final project of ME314 Machine Dynamics (Dec. 2019), NU. This project models a 2D one-legged hopping robot on a flat ground.

A few assumptions were made for simplicity:

- The foot is arrested to the ground during stance (no slip).
- The robot takes off when the leg hits the mechanical stop.
- Impacts are plastic impacts.

The robot has four degrees of freedom: 

- Position of the body CoM ($x, y$)
- Orientation of the body ($\theta$) - an actuated DoF, a hip rotation torque $\tau$ is applied
- Leg length ($l$)

# Multi-body mechanics

This [figure (Google drive link)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xa7-xilWxB23fbn64DTYG4VTU8FQm_zS/view?usp=sharing) (adapted from [2]) shows the system I'm modelling. This [figure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nDyNQ_orU9QV2BczZFm-dugfSChxgbgm/view?usp=sharing) shows the frames I'm using.

Rigid body transformations:

$$g_{wa} = \left[\begin{matrix}1 & 0 & 0 & x{\left (t \right )}\\0 & 1 & 0 & y{\left (t \right )}\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right]$$

$$g_{ab} = \left[\begin{matrix}\cos{\left (\theta{\left (t \right )} \right )} & - \sin{\left (\theta{\left (t \right )} \right )} & 0 & 0\\\sin{\left (\theta{\left (t \right )} \right )} & \cos{\left (\theta{\left (t \right )} \right )} & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right]$$

$$g_{bc} = \left[\begin{matrix}1 & 0 & 0 & - l{\left (t \right )}\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right]$$

$$g_{cd} = \left[\begin{matrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0.25\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right]$$

Specification are listed below. The free length of the spring is $L_{UB}+L_{LB}+\delta$:

- h = 0.25           # leg CG height
- $m_b$ = 3          # body mass
- $m_l$ = 0.3        # leg mass
- $I_b$ = 0.8        # body inertia
- $I_l$ = 0.008      # leg inertia
- $L_{UB}$ = 0.25      # Upper body length 
- $L_{LB}$ = 0.15      # Lower body length 
- $\delta$ = 0.002   # Spring pre-compression
- $L_L$ = 0.5        # Rigid length of leg
- $K_S$ = 2000       # spring stiffness
- $L_d$ = $L_L$ + $L_{LB}$ # desired leg length

# Phases

The motion includes five phases:

- Flight phase 1

    The constraint is the length of the leg is at its desired length. Currently the desired length is set at 0.65 m with a pre-compression of 0.002 m. No external force was added at this stage.

- Touch down impact

    The robot experienced a plastic impact. Impact equations include 'change of momentum lies perpendicular to the contact surface' and 'foot arrested to ground'. Velocity is incontinuous. There is energy loss due to the plastic impact.

- Stance phase

    The robot did a passive jump here. The constraint is that the foot is arrested to the ground. The robot took off when the leg length is at its maximun (0.65 m) and hits the mechanical stop.

- Take off impact

    Velocity is incontinuous here again. Impact equations include 'change of momentum lies perpendicular to the contact surface' and 'leg is at its maximum length'. 

- Flight phase 2

    A torque is applied to the hip joint ($\theta$) to rotate the leg forward and prepare for the next jump.

# How to run the code

- The code is written in Google Colab (Python 3)
- Sympy is used for solving symbolic equations
- It takes a few minutes for the code to run
